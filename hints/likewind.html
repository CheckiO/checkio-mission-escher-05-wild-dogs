    <div class="answer">
        To begin with, let's remember the geometry. Through every 2 points, only one line can be drawn and this line will be described by the equation k*x+b, where k and b are the defined coefficients. You need to analyze every possible pair of points from the input list and determine the equation of the line on which they lie. You can read more about the linear equations in the corresponding <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation'>article on Wikipedia</a>.

        What should I do with the obtained straight-line equations? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
Now you can see that some equations for the different pairs of points coincide. This means that all these points are on the same straight line. You need to calculate the number of each unique equation and determine the one that appears the most often.

    <div class="question">
        What do I have to do with the equation next? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
You need to determine the second coefficient in it - b. This coefficient shows the distance at which this line's nearest point from a given row of points is, if x = 0, that is, precisely in the situation described in the task.
So, by defining b, you’ll determine the distance you are looking for - the one you need to move away from the starting position to become one line with the maximum possible number of dogs and kill them with one shot.
