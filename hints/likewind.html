    <div class="answer">
        To begin with, let's remember the geometry. Through every 2 points, only one line can be drawn and this line will be described by the equation k*x+b, where k and b are the defined coefficients. You need to analyze every possible pair of points from the input list and determine the equation of the line on which they lie. You can read more about the linear equations in the corresponding <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation'>article on Wikipedia</a>.

        What should I do with the obtained straight-line equations? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
Now you can see that some equations for the different pairs of points coincide. This means that all these points are on the same straight line. You need to calculate the number of each unique equation and determine the one that appears the most often.

        What do I have to do with the equation next? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
Next you should use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line'>formula</a> to calculate the distance between point (0, 0) and the line.
